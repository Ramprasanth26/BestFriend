As said in the first line only one in millions have a purest form of soul to be existing in them. And that has to be preserved and locked to be taken care of.
Surudhi  is an emotion and an art of pureness a symbol of happiness and joy
I, Ram Prasanth is soooo blessed and extreme happy  to deserve that kind of pureness.
U deserve to be happy and sweetness till the moon dies in your pureness!
Nobody can match your place in my life!
If there is a word in dictionary to mention your importance for me I'd use it but there isn't one.
Remember that day I mentioned the word for extreme happiness
"Ecstasy" you are my "Ecstasy till Eternity"‚ù§Ô∏èü´Çüåç
Even infinite years pass I won't even dare to forget you! </p>

I keep on annoying you but you still
manage to deal with me every single time. Sometimes I become kid who constantly
needs your attention, Sometimes become a mature person,
Sometimes I act dumb, Sometimes I become sad,
Sometimes I don't believe in myself,
Sometimes I lose my confidence,
Sometimes get very negative, But you keep on supporting me at every stage. Having you by my side is the best thing that ever happened to me! I don't care if there is someone better than you because to me you are everything I ever wanted, that's better than anything anyone else can offer. Right.Listen,remember the first time we met,we were strangers,we didn't even actually knew anything about each other. But today if they ask me what the relationship I share with you.I would just say "I am blessed to have a person like you in my life". Maybe we weren't comfortable much before but in the recent months when I talk with you,l feel better, I feel I have someone who understands me.I don't share everything with people I meet. people who said they care about me left,people who said "I like the way you are" judged me when I acted weird.But then I found you. A weird person who always cared for me and no matter what I did, how rude I am, always knew how to handle my moods. From "Can I tell you something"? to "Hey,Tell me what happened" you always were with me.Sorry for being too possesive over you,  It's because I am so close to you that I cant think of losing you.</p>

Dont reply me in minutes,dont talk on calls for hours but just promise me one thing "Just dont ignore me for someone else, Just dont replace me". Please.I just dont want to again lose a special person in my life.They say soulmates are found only in life partners but they were wrong. I'm so blessed to have you in my life that I can't stop thanking the heavens above. Your precious love means more than anything to me. Your care and support is my stairway to heaven.I miss you more than anything and love u more than any languages in this world can express those! Please don't leave me at any cost. Keep me like a teddy for you till your end and I promise I will be there even at your hardest times no matter where I am! Thankyou is not a word to say between us but I dearly adore u for staying by my side and wish the same till the end!</p>

Your love has pulled me out from a dark cocoon of sadness. I was very very lonely and my lite was only surrounded by tears, sadness. misery and pain. You came in my life just like a bright glimmer of light enters a dark tunnel. You put life back into my heart and made me feel alive again. I love you so much that I want to keep irritating you till the end. I want to grow old along with you and keep roasting you even as a granny as I do now. Your kindness and care has erased all the memories of sorrow and pain that I suffered and I have almost forgotten my past. I want a beautiful and happy days of our bond to be till the end  with you. I want your face to be seen at the end before I close my eyes forever. If there comes a day in your life when the world comes crashing down on you, I will still fight the world for you until the end of time. I love you more than you will ever know.  You are my everything.</p>

            <p class="separator">Idk why you are this much important but you are something very very special for me and I have never felt this with anyone else you meant a lot more to me than myself that point you were the first person to see me as worthy, the one who always thought that i was capable of incredible things. the one who pushed me to achieve my dreams because you genuinely believed in me. i told you my darkest fears and you never once said that i was silly. when most found me as invisible, you made me feel seen in a sea full of strangers. despite my endless faults, you understood. my point of view when no one else could. i will never forget how you saw my strengths when they only counted my flaws. you were the north star i needed to weather through the winter forests because you found me when no one else cared to look. i hope these words find a way of reaching your eyes, and heart crossing the sadness if any you had in the past because i still think about the gift of kindness you gave in . i hope these words finally make admit how much i miss you in my life. Not only for Today or Tomorrow.
I chose you for lifetime and it is never going to change.
Remember, I'm here for you always. No matter what people say, no matter how you feel, trust me you always hold a special place in my heart that can never be replaced. I'll always hold your hand when you'll feel low, I'll always love you. For me, you're the reason of my smile and seeing you happy makes me happy too.
If I died in your arms, it would be right where lm supposed to be. In you, I find solace, peace, and the greatest bliss. No one completes me as much as you do. Because of you, I have discovered the meaning of true love. Thank you for sticking around through thick and thin. I still find you as attractive and cutee and sweet as the first time I saw and felt your character. Having a person with whom you don't need to think before speaking your heart out? A person with whom you can share anything without the fear of being judged. The one who listens to your nonstop talks with 100% attention. yes, I'm  thankful to God for being blessed with that person and will  never ever even dare to let you go.‚ù§Ô∏èüåè.</p>
